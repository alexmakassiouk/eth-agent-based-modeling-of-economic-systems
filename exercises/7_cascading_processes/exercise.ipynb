    "In this exercise, we implement and analyse the models presented in Lecture.  We provide you with an almost complete mesa model that implements all the model variants discussed in the lecture.\n",
    "Only the simplest *constant load inward and outward variants* are left out for you to implement. \n",
    "Then, with the model completed, you can analyse it in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "This is a good general approach: writing the highly structured and reusable core code in python modules (or packages for more complex projects) and then calling that code in a Notebook in which you perform the analysis and generate results/reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "1. **Complete the `inward` and `outward` model variants**  \n",
    "    Inspect the code provided to you.\n",
    "    You find incomplete code stubs starting on line 75 in `agent.py`, which you should complete.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Test your implementation**  \n",
    "    Run the model variant you implemented for known cascade processes and confirm the correctness of your implementation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Compute the $(\\mu, \\sigma)$ phase diagram seen in the lecture**  \n",
    "    In the lecture you saw the results of calculations from the macroscopic perspective to the problem for varying means and variances of the load distribution.  Here, you are asked to reproduce the  $(\\mu, \\sigma)$ diagram through microscopic ABM simulation\n"
